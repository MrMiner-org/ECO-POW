# ECO-POW
 This repository provides a proof‑of‑concept implementation of an eco‑friendly Proof of Work (ECO‑PoW) algorithm in C++. It features dynamic difficulty adjustment based on simulated real‑time data, a simulated Zero‑Knowledge Proof for enhanced security, and hardware‑optimized parallelized nonce search. Please note: This project is only an example and is not production‑ready.
